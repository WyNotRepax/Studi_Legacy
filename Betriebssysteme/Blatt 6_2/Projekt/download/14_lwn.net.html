announced <a

getting the best of two worlds: source builds and prebuilt binaries. This
fits well into a landscape where reproducibility and software traceability,
all the way through to device updates, are increasingly important to handle
complex security issues.

        Digging into the email that provides the cornerstone of Linux kernel
development is an endeavor that has become more popular over the last few
years.  There are some practical reasons for analyzing the
kernel mailing lists and for correlating that information with the patches
that actually reach the mainline, including tracking the path that
patches take—or don't take.  Three researchers reported on some efforts
they have made on kernel email analysis at the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference-europe-2019/">2019
Embedded Linux Conference Europe</a> (ELCE), held in late October in Lyon, France.

        This year saw the second edition of the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/ats-2019/">Automated
Testing Summit</a> (ATS) and the first that was open to all.  <a
href="https://elinux.org/Automated_Testing_Summit_2018">Last year's ATS</a> 
was an invitation-only
gathering of around 35 developers (that was described in an <a
href="/Articles/771782/">LWN article</a>),
while this year's event attracted
around 50 attendees;  both were held in conjunction with the
Embedded Linux Conference Europe (ELCE), in Edinburgh, Scotland for 2018
and in Lyon, France this year.  The basic problem has not changed—more
collaboration is needed between the different kernel testing systems—but
the starting points have been identified and work is progressing, albeit
slowly.  Part of the problem, of course, is that all of these testing
efforts have their own constituencies and customers, who must be kept up
and running, even while any of this collaborative development is going on.

        A set of patches has just been pushed into the mainline repository (and
stable updates) for yet
another set of hardware vulnerabilities.  "TSX async abort" (or TAA)
exposes information through the usual side channels by way of internal
buffers used with the transactional memory (TSX) instructions.  Mitigation
is done by disabling TSX or by clearing the relevant buffers when switching
between kernel and user mode.  Given that this is not the first problem
with TSX, disabling it entirely is recommended; a microcode update may be
needed to do so, though.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a7a248c593e4">This commit</a> contains
documentation on this vulnerability and its mitigation.
<p>
There are also fixes for <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7f00cc8d4a51">another vulnerability</a>:
it seems that accessing a memory address immediately after the size of the
page containing it was changed (from a regular to a huge page, for
example) can cause the processor to lock up.  This behavior is considered
undesirable by many.  The vulnerability only
exists for pages marked as executable; the mitigation is to force all
executable pages to be the regular, 4K page size.

        Many community-based Linux distributions have made the decision to switch
to systemd, and most of those decisions were accompanied by lengthy,
sometimes acrimonious mailing-list discussions. No distribution had a
harder time of it than Debian, though, where arguments raged through much
of 2013 before the Debian Technical Committee <a
href="/Articles/585319/">decided</a> on systemd in early 2014.  Thereafter,
it is fair to say,
appetite for renewing the init-system discussion has been low.  Now,
though, the topic has returned to the fore and
it would appear that the project is heading toward a new general
resolution to decide at what level init systems other than systemd should
be supported.

        Operating systems and computing hardware both carry a lot of their history
with them.  The x86 I/O-port mechanism is one piece of that history; it is
rarely used by hardware designed in the last 20 years, but it must
still be supported.  That doesn't mean that this support can't be cleaned
up and improved, though, especially when the old implementation turns out
to have some unpleasant properties.  An example can be seen in <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20191106193459.581614484@linutronix.de/">the
<tt>iopl()</tt> patch set</a> from Thomas Gleixner.

        As of this writing, just over 14,000 non-merge changesets have found their
way into the mainline repository for the 5.4 release; that is a bit less
than we saw for 5.3, but more than most of the other recent kernels.  The
final 5.4 release is approaching, so it must be time for our usual look at
where the code merged in this development cycle came from.  It's mostly
business as usual in the kernel community, modulo an appearance from none
other than Hulk Robot.

we hosted information about the program and retailers as a simple page on

one device, this was certainly satisfactory. As the program grew, we added
each new device chronologically to that page, highlighting the newest
certifications. We are now in a place where eight different retailers have

        Running untrusted code in a safe manner is generally the goal of sandboxing
efforts.  The sandbox technique presented by Georgia Tech PhD student
Ashish Bijlani at <a 
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/">Open 
Source Summit Europe 2019</a> is no exception.  He has used something of a novel
scheme to allow unprivileged code to implement the sandbox policies using
BPF; the policies are then enforced by the kernel.

        At <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/">Open
Source Summit Europe 2019</a>, Michael C. Jaeger and Maximilian Huber
updated attendees on the <a href="https://www.fossology.org">FOSSology
project</a>, which is an open-source license-compliance tool.   They
introduced FOSSology and talked about how it can be used, but they also
looked at the new features added in the last few releases.  Beyond that,
they presented some experiments the project has been doing with creating
machine-learning models for license recognition.

        The <a href="/Articles/804262/">seventh 5.4 prepatch</a> is out for
testing.  "<span>Nothing looks _bad_, but there is too much of it.

So I'm leaning towards an rc8 being likely next weekend due to that,
but I won't make a final decision yet. We'll see.</span>"
