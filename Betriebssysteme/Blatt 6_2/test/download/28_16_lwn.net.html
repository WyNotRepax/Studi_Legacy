        The arm64 architecture is found at the core of many, if not most, mobile
devices; that means that arm64 devices are destined to be the target of
attackers worldwide.  That has led to a high level of interest in
technologies that can harden these systems.  There are currently several
such technologies, based in both hardware and software, that are being
readied for the arm64 kernel; read on for a survey on what is
coming.

        One of the many responsibilities of the operating system is to help
processes keep secrets from each other.  Operating systems often fail in
this regard, sometimes due to factors — such as hardware bugs and user-space
vulnerabilities — that are beyond their direct control.  It is thus
unsurprising that there is an increasing level of interest in ways to
improve the ability to keep data secret, perhaps even from the operating
system itself.  The <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/1572171452-7958-1-git-send-email-rppt@kernel.org/"><tt>MAP_EXCLUSIVE</tt></a>
patch set from Mike Rapoport is one example of the work that is being done
in this area; it also shows that the development community has not yet
really begun to figure out how this type of feature should work.

        Digging into the email that provides the cornerstone of Linux kernel
development is an endeavor that has become more popular over the last few
years.  There are some practical reasons for analyzing the
kernel mailing lists and for correlating that information with the patches
that actually reach the mainline, including tracking the path that
patches take—or don't take.  Three researchers reported on some efforts
they have made on kernel email analysis at the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference-europe-2019/">2019
Embedded Linux Conference Europe</a> (ELCE), held in late October in Lyon, France.

"<span>In recent exploits, one of the steps for making the attacker’s life
easier is to disable CPU protections like Supervisor Mode Access (and
Execute) Prevention (SMAP and SMEP) by finding a way to write to CPU
control registers to disable these features. For example, CR4 controls SMAP
and SMEP, where disabling those would let an attacker access and execute
userspace memory from kernel code again, opening up the attack to much
greater flexibility. CR0 controls Write Protect (WP), which when disabled
would allow an attacker to write to read-only memory like the kernel code
itself. Attacks have been using the kernel’s CR4 and CR0 writing functions
to make these changes (since it’s easier to gain that level of execute
control), but now the kernel will attempt to 'pin' sensitive bits in CR4
and CR0 to avoid them getting disabled. This forces attacks to do more work
to enact such register changes going forward.</span>"

        This year saw the second edition of the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/ats-2019/">Automated
Testing Summit</a> (ATS) and the first that was open to all.  <a
href="https://elinux.org/Automated_Testing_Summit_2018">Last year's ATS</a> 
was an invitation-only
gathering of around 35 developers (that was described in an <a
href="/Articles/771782/">LWN article</a>),
while this year's event attracted
around 50 attendees;  both were held in conjunction with the
Embedded Linux Conference Europe (ELCE), in Edinburgh, Scotland for 2018
and in Lyon, France this year.  The basic problem has not changed—more
collaboration is needed between the different kernel testing systems—but
the starting points have been identified and work is progressing, albeit
slowly.  Part of the problem, of course, is that all of these testing
efforts have their own constituencies and customers, who must be kept up
and running, even while any of this collaborative development is going on.

        Many community-based Linux distributions have made the decision to switch
to systemd, and most of those decisions were accompanied by lengthy,
sometimes acrimonious mailing-list discussions. No distribution had a
harder time of it than Debian, though, where arguments raged through much
of 2013 before the Debian Technical Committee <a
href="/Articles/585319/">decided</a> on systemd in early 2014.  Thereafter,
it is fair to say,
appetite for renewing the init-system discussion has been low.  Now,
though, the topic has returned to the fore and
it would appear that the project is heading toward a new general
resolution to decide at what level init systems other than systemd should
be supported.

        Operating systems and computing hardware both carry a lot of their history
with them.  The x86 I/O-port mechanism is one piece of that history; it is
rarely used by hardware designed in the last 20 years, but it must
still be supported.  That doesn't mean that this support can't be cleaned
up and improved, though, especially when the old implementation turns out
to have some unpleasant properties.  An example can be seen in <a

<tt>iopl()</tt> patch set</a> from Thomas Gleixner.

        As of this writing, just over 14,000 non-merge changesets have found their
way into the mainline repository for the 5.4 release; that is a bit less
than we saw for 5.3, but more than most of the other recent kernels.  The
final 5.4 release is approaching, so it must be time for our usual look at
where the code merged in this development cycle came from.  It's mostly
business as usual in the kernel community, modulo an appearance from none
other than Hulk Robot.

        A set of patches has just been pushed into the mainline repository (and
stable updates) for yet
another set of hardware vulnerabilities.  "TSX async abort" (or TAA)
exposes information through the usual side channels by way of internal
buffers used with the transactional memory (TSX) instructions.  Mitigation
is done by disabling TSX or by clearing the relevant buffers when switching
between kernel and user mode.  Given that this is not the first problem
with TSX, disabling it entirely is recommended; a microcode update may be
needed to do so, though.  <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/a7a248c593e4">This commit</a> contains
documentation on this vulnerability and its mitigation.
<p>
There are also fixes for <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7f00cc8d4a51">another vulnerability</a>:
it seems that accessing a memory address immediately after the size of the
page containing it was changed (from a regular to a huge page, for
example) can cause the processor to lock up.  This behavior is considered
undesirable by many.  The vulnerability only
exists for pages marked as executable; the mitigation is to force all
executable pages to be the regular, 4K page size.
