        When <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">virtio</a>
was merged in Linux v2.6.24, its author, Rusty Russell, <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ec3d41c4db4c">described 
the goal</a> as being for "<span>common drivers to be efficiently used
across most virtual I/O 
mechanisms</span>".  Today, much progress has been made toward that goal, with virtio
supported by multiple hypervisors and guest drivers shipped by many operating
systems.  But these applications of virtio are implemented in software, whereas
Michael Tsirkin's "<a
href="https://kvmforum2019.sched.com/event/TmxF/virtio-without-the-virt-towards-implementations-in-hardware-michael-tsirkin-red-hat">VirtIO
without the Virt</a>" talk at KVM Forum 2019 laid out how
to implement virtio in hardware.

        Fedora's <a href="https://docs.pagure.org/modularity/">Modularity
initiative</a> has been no stranger to controversy since its <a
href="/Articles/680278/">inception</a> in 2016.  Among other things, there
were enough problems with the original design that Modularity <a

Modularity has since been integrated with both the Fedora and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distributions, but the controversy continues, with
some developers asking whether it's time for yet another redesign â€” or to
abandon the idea altogether.  Over the last month or so, several lengthy,
detailed, and heated threads have explored this issue; read on for your
editor's attempt to integrate what was said.

        <p>
        The idea of stacking (or chaining) Linux
security modules (LSMs) <a href="/Articles/114588/">goes back 
15 years</a> (at least) at this point; <a href="/Articles/635771/">progress</a>
has definitely been made along 
the way, especially in the last decade or so.  It has been possible to
stack "minor" LSMs with one major LSM (e.g. SELinux, Smack, or AppArmor) for
some time, but mixing, say, SELinux and AppArmor in the same 
system has not been possible.  Combining major security solutions may not
seem like a truly important feature, but there is a use case where it is
pretty clearly needed: containers.  Longtime LSM stacker (and Smack
maintainer) Casey Schaufler
gave a presentation at the <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/linux-security-summit-europe-2019/">2019
Linux Security Summit Europe</a> to report on the status and plans for
allowing arbitrary LSM stacking.

        A key tenet in KVM is to reuse as much Linux infrastructure as possible
and focus specifically on processor virtualization. Back in 2007, this
meant a smaller code base and less friction with the other kernel
subsystems, especially when compared with other virtualization technologies
such as Xen. This led to KVM being merged into the mainline with relative
ease.  A talk at this year's KVM Forum looks at ways to better protect
guests, perhaps by moving away from that tenet.

The post details the search for the problem, which was apparently being used in the wild, its fix, and how it can be exploited.  This is all part of an effort to "<span>make zero-day hard</span>"; one of the steps the project is taking is to disseminate more information on these bugs. "<span>Complete detailed analysis of the 0-days from the point of view of bug hunters and exploit developers and share it back with the community. Transparency and collaboration are key. We want to share detailed root cause analysis to inform developers and defenders on how to prevent these types of bugs in the future and improve detection. We hope that by publishing details about the exploit and its methodology, this can inform threat intelligence and incident responders. Overall, we want to make information thatâ€™s often kept in silos accessible to all.</span>"

        The 13th <a
href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum-2019/">KVM
Forum</a> virtualization conference took place in Lyon, France in October
2019. One might think that development may have finished on the Kernel
Virtual Machine (KVM) module that was merged in Linux 2.6.20 in 2007, but
this year's conference underscored the amount of work still being done,
particularly on side-channel attack mitigation, I/O device assignment with
VFIO and mdev, footprint reduction with micro virtual machines (VMs), and
with the ability to 
run VMs nested within VMs. Many talks also involved the virtual machine
monitor (VMM) user-space programs that use the KVM kernel moduleâ€”of which
<a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> is the most widely used.

        The arm64 architecture is found at the core of many, if not most, mobile
devices; that means that arm64 devices are destined to be the target of
attackers worldwide.  That has led to a high level of interest in
technologies that can harden these systems.  There are currently several
such technologies, based in both hardware and software, that are being
readied for the arm64 kernel; read on for a survey on what is
coming.

        One of the many responsibilities of the operating system is to help
processes keep secrets from each other.  Operating systems often fail in
this regard, sometimes due to factors â€” such as hardware bugs and user-space
vulnerabilities â€” that are beyond their direct control.  It is thus
unsurprising that there is an increasing level of interest in ways to
improve the ability to keep data secret, perhaps even from the operating
system itself.  The <a

patch set from Mike Rapoport is one example of the work that is being done
in this area; it also shows that the development community has not yet
really begun to figure out how this type of feature should work.

        The <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org">Yocto Project</a> recently
announced <a
href="https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto-announce/2019-October/000169.html">its 
3.0 release</a>, maintaining the spring/fall cadence it has followed for the
past nine years. As well as the expected updates, it contains new thinking on
getting the best of two worlds: source builds and prebuilt binaries. This
fits well into a landscape where reproducibility and software traceability,
all the way through to device updates, are increasingly important to handle
complex security issues.
